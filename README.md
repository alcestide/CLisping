# Common Lisp Playground
Experimenting with **Common Lisp** while trying to gain a personal knowledge about the language, by reading books, documentations, following courses and just trying to understand how Lisp works *under the hood*. My little personal compendium of **snippets** of **code** and probably even some notes. I hope this repo will get pretty huge in the near future.

*In Lisp we Trust.*
